Predicting Housing Prices in King County with Python
# Overview
In this project, I am playing the role of a Data Analyst working at a Real Estate Investment Trust. Our Trust is seeking to diversify its investment portfolio by venturing into the residential real estate market. To facilitate this new initiative, I have been tasked with developing a model to determine the market price of a house based on a set of specific features.

The objective of this project is to analyze and predict housing prices using various attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and other relevant characteristics. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques, I aim to create a robust model that can accurately estimate the market value of a residential property given its features.
